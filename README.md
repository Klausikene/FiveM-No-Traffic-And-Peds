FiveM No Traffic And Peds

A simple resource to remove all ped and vehicles.
>This resource disables all locals by setting ped and vehicle budgets to zero.

This script removes traffic and peds from the world.

You are able to change the values in the 'traffic_density.lua' file. Simply change the values of 'pedFrequency' and 'trafficFrequency' to whatever you like. Keep in mind that it has to be between 0.0 and 1.0 Anything above 1.0 will not work and won't affect anything. It is simply what Rockstar has as a maximum value.

#Important sidenote The values you enter HAVE to be FLOAT values. That means that they have to be decimal numbers. They have to be formatted like this: 0.0 or 1.0 or 0.6 You get what I mean right?

There is nothing else you really have to touch or edit besides the 'pedFrequency' and 'trafficFrequency'.

Have fun!
